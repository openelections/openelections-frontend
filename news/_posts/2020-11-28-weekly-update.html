<p>Here's an update on our work obtaining and converting official election results from the 2020 general election. As more states certify their results, we're adding entire states and selected counties.</p>

<h4>Statewide Results Done</h4>

<p>This week we've posted statewide precinct results from the following states: <a href="https://github.com/openelections/openelections-data-hi/blob/master/2020/20201103__hi__general__precinct.csv">Hawaii</a>, <a href="https://github.com/openelections/openelections-data-nd/blob/master/2020/20201103__nd__general__precinct.csv">North Dakota</a> and <a href="https://github.com/openelections/openelections-data-vt/blob/master/2020/20201103__vt__general__precinct.csv">Vermont</a>. You can keep track of our progress <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15_7PV0AuLjMgutAGiuGVquZJQ2l0lWkusckuHhIBXrQ/edit#gid=855728786">here</a>.</p>

<h4>Collecting Official Results by County</h4>

<p>We've expanded the number of states where we are collecting results directly from counties this year in an effort to provide as much detail as possible about an election conducted under very unusual circumstances. In particular, states like Florida, Missouri and Michigan that provide a single precinct results file do not include breakouts of votes by type (early voting vs. election day, for example) which is critical information for the 2020 election. That's on top of our usual collection from counties in Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, Utah, Texas and California. This will mean that we won't post results as quickly for some states, but thanks to the work of our volunteers on the 2020 primaries we're in a better position to parse more results files faster. Our collection efforts right now are focused on <a href="https://github.com/openelections/openelections-sources-mi/issues/7">Michigan</a>, <a href="https://github.com/openelections/openelections-sources-fl/issues/1">Florida</a> and <a href="https://github.com/openelections/openelections-sources-mo/issues/5">Missouri</a>.</p>

<p>As we collect county files, we need to convert them, typically from PDF format to CSVs. We're doing that in <a href="https://github.com/openelections/openelections-data-mi/issues/28">Michigan</a>, <a href="https://github.com/openelections/openelections-data-mo/issues/20">Missouri</a> and <a href="https://github.com/openelections/openelections-data-fl/issues/1">Florida</a>, <a href="https://github.com/openelections/openelections-data-mi/issues/28">Michigan</a>, <a href="https://github.com/openelections/openelections-data-ut/issues/41">Utah</a> and <a href="https://github.com/openelections/openelections-data-or/issues/197">Oregon</a>, and will be adding other states to the mix when they certify.</p>

<h4>This Week's Work</h4>

<p>This week we have added the following converted official general election results:</p>

<ul>
  <li>precinct results for 14 Mississippi counties</li>
  <li>precinct results for 9 Florida counties</li>
  <li>precinct results for 5 Michigan counties</li>
  <li>precinct results for 2 Utah counties</li>
  <li>precinct results for 1 Oregon county</li>
</ul>

<p>That's in addition to our ongoing work on 2020 primary elections in multiple states.</p>

<p>We've also been collecting official precinct results from these states:</p>

<ul>
  <li>New York (<a href="https://github.com/openelections/openelections-sources-ny/issues/12">11 counties</a>)</li>
  <li>Pennsylvania (<a href="https://github.com/openelections/openelections-sources-pa/issues/8">15 counties</a>)</li>
</ul>

<h4>One Last Thing</h4>

<p>We're also committing to producing county-level results with as much detail as possible. That means breaking out votes by type where possible, like we're doing in <a href="https://github.com/openelections/openelections-data-mi/blob/master/2020/20201103__mi__general__county.csv">Michigan</a>. As always, we rely on the support and efforts of lots of volunteers; if you'd like to join them, email us at openelections@gmail.com.</p>
